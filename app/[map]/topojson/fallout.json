Attis was one of the commanders of the faction of super mutants who fled to the East after the death of the Master and the destruction of Mariposa Military Base. Starting to talk about themselves, Rhombus, now High Elder of the Brotherhood of Steel, thinking they were a threat, demanded during the elder council that the Brotherhood look into it. But the elder council answered in the negative, because the former expedition grew by similar ambitions (track down and assess the extent of the remaining super mutant threat) against the Gammorin's Army, and the incident ensuing divided the Brotherhood, creating a splinter faction of the Brotherhood of Steel.","faction":"Attis's Army","name":"Attis's Army","type":"falloutFaction"},"type":"Polygon"},{"arcs":[[100,101,102]],"properties":{"description":"After the death of John Maxson, Rhombus, the head of the Brotherhood's Paladins, became the new High Elder.

The debate went lightly. Finally, the elders ruled against sharing the technology with outsiders, convinced that they would endure what they had before. Further discussion was discouraged when the elders ordered the minority who wished to share their technology on a mission across the wastes. The Brotherhood constructed airships and dispatched the minority East, to track down and assess the extent of the remaining super mutant threat. However, as they traveled over the great mountains a great storm broke the main airship and flung it far from its course. The mighty airship was badly damaged, the smaller sections were torn from the main craft and never to be seen again. Many of the expedition leaders, including Paladin Latham, were lost to the winds. The fraction of the crew that still survived, struggled to keep their ship aloft before finally crashing on the outskirts of the ruins of Chicago. Survivors eventually formed a new organization, which diverged greatly from the ideals of the old Brotherhood. In time, they established a harsh rule over the towns and villages in that area.","faction":"Brotherhood of Steel","name":"Midwest Brotherhood","type":"falloutFaction"},"type":"Polygon"},{"arcs":[[-115,-114,-113,-112,116,117]],"properties":{"description":"Gammorin's Army is one of the two most important offshoots of the Master's Army, along with the Attis Army, initially led by a super mutant called Gammorin, and later by ex-Brotherhood of Steel Paladin Latham, who took Gammorin's name as his own.","faction":"Gammorin's Army","name":"Gammorin's Army","type":"falloutFaction"},"type":"Polygon"},{"arcs":[[118]],"properties":{"description":"The Reaver Movement was founded many decades before 2197 in the Midwest.
